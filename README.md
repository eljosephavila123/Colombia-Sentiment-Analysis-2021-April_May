## News (Keys to understanding the protests in Colombia and the outrage over the tax reform)

```txt

After several days of protests and strong police repression against the protesters, President Iv√°n Duque 
announced on Sunday the withdrawal of the tax reform bill before Congress.

Social organizations of workers, indigenous people and students took to the streets of Colombia despite 
the coronavirus crisis, to protest against the project called Sustainable Solidarity Law.

With it, the Duque government seeks to raise an additional 23 trillion Colombian pesos(about US $ 6,300 
million dollars) to face the economic crisis in which the country isplunged, very affected by the 
coronavirus pandemic.

But protesters do not agree with the tax hike envisaged by the government project, which they say falls
primarily on  the lower and middle classes.
